			<div class="col" style="padding-left: 6em;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, sans-serif;">
			<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Food and cloths are one of the basic necessities of humans. Also because the number of 
				underprivileged children/students in India is significant , commodities like stationary and toys 
				are also a major requisites for them.</p>
				<p>Despite phenomenal industrial and economic growth and while India produces sufficient food 
					to feed its population, it is unable to provide access to food to a large number of people. 
					According to FAO estimates in â€˜The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, 2020 
					report, 189.2 million people are undernourished in India. By this measure 14% of the 
					population is undernourished in India. According to the latest survey, 1.3 billion tons of food 
					is thrown as waste every year.Additionally, one-third of the food consumed is stated as leftovers.</p>
					<p> The main Goal of DoNation is to reduce the amount of  wastage in general be it 'Food' , 'Cloths' or other commodities. Our mission is to create a transparent system for all kinds of donations.</p>
